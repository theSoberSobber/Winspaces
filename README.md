# Todo
- in memory dictionary to focus the window on the workspace when on it (plays nice with yasb too)
- sys tray icon
- send message to a window HWND if it can find it (so that some bar may then come and handle it in UI)
- have VDA be not uploaded explicitly but from the VDA repo as a module of sorts or GH actions atleast to update commit it
- distribute exe with ahk 2 exe and bundle with dll to get a staging release
- Win key disable reg edit bat script (uses gsudo for escalation or explicit init UAC)

# Maybe?
- pinning windows?
